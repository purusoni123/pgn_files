In May 2012, Court commissioned external reviews focused on three areas of the Bank’s performance and capabilities that had been tested in the financial crisis: the arrangements for providing emergency liquidity support to an institution; the framework for providing liquidity to the banking system as a whole; and the MPC’s forecasting capability. Each review was conducted by an internationally respected expert, with support from Bank staff, and made a number of recommendations. The Bank’s responses to the recommendations were published in March 2013. Implementation of the reviews has been monitored by the Oversight Committee. Many of the initiatives reported elsewhere in this Annual Report flow directly from the reviews.
