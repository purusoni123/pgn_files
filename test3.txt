The Bank, through the PRA, is responsible for the prudential regulation and supervision of banks, building societies, designated investment firms and insurance companies. Effective supervision of these institutions will support financial stability. The strategy for conducting effective supervision adopted by the PRA Board, which is summarised here, is published in full in the PRA’s separate Annual Report. The Financial Services Act 2012 sets out the PRA’s general objectives as to promote the safety and soundness of these regulated firms and, specifically for insurers, to contribute to the securing of an appropriate degree of protection for policyholders. the PRA also has a secondary objective, subordinated to its general objectives, to facilitate effective competition in the markets for services provided by PRA-authorised firms. The PRA Board oversees the fulfilment of
these objectives and takes the most significant supervisory decisions.
