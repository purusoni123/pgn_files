The Bank has a timeless mission: to promote the good of the people of the United Kingdom by maintaining monetary and financial stability. But the way we discharge that responsibility needs to be constantly refreshed if we are to meet the needs of the public we serve. In May 2017, we launched our new ‘Vision 2020’ Strategic Plan. Vision 2020 will build on and reinforce the successes of our One Bank Strategic Plan, as well as the values and pillars that support it, as we look ahead to responding to the challenges of the future. Every member of staff had an opportunity to have their say about how we can best solve these challenges, and as a result has helped shape the development of Vision 2020. We held a series of workshops, open to everyone, to share ideas and proposals, and we visited external organisations to understand how others have dealt with similar challenges. The core aim of Vision 2020 is to unlock the true potential of all our people by increasing empowerment and maximising our impact. To do that we need to change the way we work to ensure diverse, expert people work together and more often — across disciplines and across areas — to solve the policy challenges we face. And we need to further support our staff by offering varied and interesting careers while providing targeted training and development to equip them with the full set of skills they need.
