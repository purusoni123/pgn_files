The Bank of England’s Financial Policy Committee contributes to the Bank’s mission to achieve financial stability by identifying, monitoring and taking action to remove or reduce systemic risks with a view to protecting and enhancing the stability of the United Kingdom’s financial system. Subject to that, it supports the economic policy of the Government, including its objectives for growth and employment. In June 2016 following the EU referendum the FPC acted quickly to reduce the countercyclical buffer rate on banks’ UK exposures. This was a response to greater uncertainty around the UK economic outlook and the increased possibility that material domestic risks could crystallise in the near term. The reduction of the buffer rate was intended to reinforce the FPC’s expectation that all elements of capital and liquidity buffers are able to be drawn on to support the real economy when necessary. Looking forward, there are a range of possible outcomes arising from the exit negotiations between the United Kingdom and the European Union. The FPC will oversee contingency plans to mitigate risks to financial stability as this process unfolds. It will also assess the financial stability implications of regulated firms’ plans to adapt to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Union.
