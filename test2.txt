The Oversight Committee, either in Court or separately, receives briefings after each MPC, FPC and PRA Board meeting and there is a full discussion either at a Court or at an Oversight Committee meeting. Members of the Oversight Committee also receive key papers prepared for the three committees, and have exercised their rights to attend meetings as observers.
