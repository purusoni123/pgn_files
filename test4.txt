In addition to health and safety, the SHE Committee monitors the impact of the Bank’s operations on the environment. By managing waste production/disposal and reducing energy usage through better power efficiency, the Bank is able to minimise its impact on the environment. Recent replacement of engineering plant at the Bank’s premises saw an improvement in efficiency and a reduction in consumption. This reduction is reflected in the displayed energy certificate. More than 98%, or 1,439 tonnes, of waste generated by the Bank is recycled or reused. One third of this waste is utilised in the production of power through the burning of the waste material at an award winning ‘Energy from Waste’ facility. The Bank’s main publications, including this Annual Report, are printed on paper which contains at least 50% recovered waste and 50% virgin fibre and is certified as a Forest Stewardship Council mixed sources product.
