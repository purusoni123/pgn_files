The Bank is determined to enhance its research capabilities by expanding its pool of researchers and creating a ‘One Bank’ research strategy. As part of the Strategic Plan, the brief of the Chief Economist has been extended to direct the research programme across the entire Bank. Work has already begun on the impact of the Funding for Lending Scheme and quantitative easing. Work has also been done to assess the possible implications for financial stability of changing interest rates and bank forbearance. And progress has been made towards understanding the UK productivity puzzle
