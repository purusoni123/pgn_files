The environment currently faced by the Mexican economy is characterized by high uncertainty. 

In addition to the possible impact of the U.S. elections outcome on the bilateral relation with Mexico, lies the possibility of new volatility episodes related to several risks still prevailing in the international economy. 

Among them, the following should be listed: doubts regarding the course of trade relations between the U.K. and the European Union, high vulnerabilities faced by some of the main emerging economies and the persistent uncertainty regarding the possible consequences of the U.S. monetary policy normalization process. 

To face these risks, and, thus, to contribute to the strengthening of the macroeconomic framework in Mexico, the monetary policy actions were complemented by fiscal consolidation measures drafted by the Ministry of Finance in the 2017 Economic Package and approved by the Mexican Parliament. 

These actions, along with the recently announced PEMEX 2016-2017 business plan, which establishes the guidelines for the financial strengthening of the State-owned Production Company, will contribute to solidifying the economic fundamentals of the economy, allowing to efficiently absorb external shocks and, in turn, fostering greater financial stability.
