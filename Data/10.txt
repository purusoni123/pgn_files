Annual headline inflation registered, until September 2016, seventeen consecutive months below 3 percent, even though in October it slightly exceeded this figure, as a result of the gradual upward trend maintained by core inflation, as well as the impact generated by the increment in gasoline prices at the Northern border

The performance of core inflation is mainly accounted for by the evolution of the merchandise price subindex, which has been responding to the depreciation of the national currency

The persistently low inflation during the reported period stemmed from the conduct of monetary policy, from the absence of significant aggregate demand-related pressures onto prices, from low international prices of most commodities and from price reductions in some widely-used inputs, which derived, in part, from the efforts of the structural reforms.
