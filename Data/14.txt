Merchandise goods are mostly internationally traded goods, while services, with certain exceptions, are not. 

Hence, this analysis considers merchandise as tradable goods and services as non-tradable ones. 

Considering that the nominal exchange rate tends to be the first variable to adjust upon different shocks affecting real parity, from a statistical point of view it would be expected that causality would move from the bilateral real exchange rate towards relative prices; that is, that the future performance of relative prices would respond to the changes observed in the real exchange rate. 

In the case of Mexico, the adjustment in relative prices in light of the changes in the real exchange rate does not seem instantaneous, but rather it takes place over a relatively ample time frame. 

Additionally, changes in relative prices are smoother and seem to exclusively follow the long-term trend of the bilateral real exchange rate, without reflecting its intrinsic volatility.
