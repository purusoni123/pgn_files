Mexico is in a position of strength to face this new environment, as a result of achievements reached and foreseen in terms of consolidation of public finances; of applying preemptive monetary policy measures that have been adopted this year; of a solvent and well-capitalized financial system with no liquidity problems; and of an unprecedented process of structural reforms.

Nevertheless, it is inevitable to continue dealing with both existing and emerging risks, by further strengthening the macroeconomic fundamentals of the country.

Accordingly, Banco de México continued to respond with total flexibility and at the moment and magnitude required by conditions, in order to counteract inflation pressures and to maintain inflation expectations anchored.

Thus, even though in its monetary policy decision of August the Board of Governors kept the target for the Overnight Interbank Interest Rate unchanged, in its decisions of September and November the said rate was increased by 50 basis points in each occasion, marking a level of 5.25 percent.

This was done in order to counteract inflation pressures and to maintain inflation expectations anchored.
