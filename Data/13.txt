The real exchange rate is one of the main adjustment variables in an open economy in case shocks affecting the country’s external accounts should occur. 

By inducing changes in the relative prices of tradable goods with respect to non-tradable goods, the structure of spending and production of the economy mitigates the effects of such shocks. 

For instance, if a given external shock implies a lower potential of external revenues for the economy, a real exchange rate depreciation leads to a rise in the relative price of tradable goods with respect to non-tradable ones. 

This results in greater production and lower relative spending on the said goods, mitigating pressures on the country’s external accounts. 

In a context in which prices are not immediately adjusted in the short term upon external shocks, the nominal exchange rate indeed adjusts first. 

In this sense, the latter variable dominates short-term adjustments of the real exchange rate, and, only after a certain lag, domestic relative prices of tradable goods with respect to non-tradable goods are adjusted to the new environment. 

Therefore, it is important to do a statistical analysis that would allow to pinpoint if this transmission channel is indeed present in Mexico and to measure the speed of adjustment in relative domestic prices.
