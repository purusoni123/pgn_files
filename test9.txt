The Bank announced in late 2013 that the next 5 and 10 banknotes will be printed on polymer, rather than on the cotton paper used currently. The decision followed a three-year research programme by the Bank and extensive consultation with industry and the public. Over the course of two months, the Bank hosted events across the UK to give the public the opportunity to learn more about polymer banknotes, handle prototypes and provide feedback. Nearly 13,000 individuals commented, of whom 87% were in favour of polymer; only 6% were opposed.
