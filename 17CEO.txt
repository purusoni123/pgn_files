The Independent Evaluation Office, which was formed in 2014 under a Director reporting directly to the Chairman of Court, supports the Committee and Court in discharging the oversight functions. During the year the IEO completed reviews of the Bank’s performance in economic forecasting and of the PRA’s approach to its secondary competition objective. Both of these reports were published, and made recommendations for change which the Bank is implementing. During the coming year the IEO has proposed and agreed with Court two further reviews: one into the Bank’s approach to the supervision of FMI — clearing and settlement — entities; and another into the PRA’s supervision of insurance firms. The IEO has also arranged in-depth briefings for the non-executives on issues that may be discussed in Court or the subject of future reports. In the current year these have included FEMR, the Bank’s banking operations, the structural reform project, the RTGS review, the Sterling Monetary Framework, the Bank’s framework for providing emergency liquidity assistance, the resilience of the Bank and the financial sector to cyber attack, the Bank’s arrangements for monitoring financial risk and the Bank’s talent management framework.
