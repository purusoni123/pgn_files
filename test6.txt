A Bank that builds on the successes of the past quarter century in combining clear objectives, good governance and constructive transparency. The new legal framework governing the Bank confers greater statutory powers and duties on the institution than at any time in its history. Ultimately, these powers can only be effective if the Bank earns and retains the democratic legitimacy to perform the functions given to
it. For the delivery of statutory objectives, the Bank is accountable to the public, through Parliament’s Treasury Committee. Parliament has also created the Oversight Committee to review the Bank’s overall financial management and performance.
