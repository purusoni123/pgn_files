The growth in households’ disposable income gained momentum in 2016, mostly thanks to the ongoing recovery in employment. The inequality indices, which had fallen slightly between 2014 and 2015, remained unchanged, but many people are still suffering economic hardship; the share of individuals in absolute poverty, which more than doubled during the crisis, continued to be at high levels. Consumption expanded further, supported by the improved outlook for income and favourable credit conditions, as well as the increase in household wealth, which in the preceding years was affected by the decline in real estate prices. Household confidence indices fell gradually in 2016, though they remain relatively high. Households’ propensity to save stabilized, but it was still significantly below the average levels recorded in the past ten years. The increase in household wealth, equal to 9.4 times disposable income in 2016, reflected the greater flow of savings. In the housing market sales are recovering and prices are showing the first signs of picking up. Households continued to invest in deposits and asset management products that facilitate portfolio diversification, leading also to an increase in the share of the total portfolio comprised of foreign securities. Households stepped up their borrowing, driven by the recovery in disposable income, the improved housing market outlook, and better lending conditions.
